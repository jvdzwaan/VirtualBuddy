# Virtual Buddy Prototype

This is the source code of the Virtual Buddy Prototype. The Virtual Buddy prototype was developed during my PhD research (2009-2014). More information and a demo of the software can be found at the [Empathic Virtual Buddy Project home page](http://ict1.tbm.tudelft.nl/empathicbuddy/).

## Installation/usage

The source code can be imported as a project in [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/).

The Virtual Buddy requires the [AffectButton](http://www.joostbroekens.com/#AffectButton) and [jcdmline](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcmdline/). Download the jars and add them to the build path of the Virtual Buddy project in Elcipse.
